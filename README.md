# lyrinkaOS
 A lightweight operating system for Cortex - M processors. 
 This OS is different from the previous lyrinkaOS, now lyrinkaOS.old, which is based on coroutines. 
 
 The operating system is designed and tested on STM32 MCUs. Software simulation and STM32F103C8T6 would be used for development and debugging and further plans include migrating to STM32F030C8T6 and STM32F411CEU6, covering mainstream Cortex - M0/3/4 cores.
